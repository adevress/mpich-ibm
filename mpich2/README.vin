			MPICH2 Release %VERSION%

MPICH2 is a high-performance and widely portable implementation of the
MPI-2.2 standard from the Argonne National Laboratory. This release
has all MPI 2.2 functions and features required by the standard with
the exception of support for the "external32" portable I/O format and
user-defined data representations for I/O.

The distribution has been tested by us on a variety of machines in our
environments as well as our partner institutes. If you have problems
with the installation or usage of MPICH2, please send an email to
mpich-discuss@mcs.anl.gov (you need to subscribe to this list
(https://lists.mcs.anl.gov/mailman/listinfo/mpich-discuss) before
sending an email). If you have found a bug in MPICH2, we request that
you report it at our bug tracking system:
(https://trac.mcs.anl.gov/projects/mpich2/newticket).

This README file should contain enough information to get you started
with MPICH2. More extensive installation and user guides can be found
in the doc/installguide/install.pdf and doc/userguide/user.pdf files
respectively. Additional information regarding the contents of the
release can be found in the CHANGES file in the top-level directory,
and in the RELEASE_NOTES file, where certain restrictions are
detailed. Finally, the MPICH2 web site,
http://www.mcs.anl.gov/research/projects/mpich2, contains information
on bug fixes and new releases.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

I. Getting Started
==================

The following instructions take you through a sequence of steps to get
the default configuration (ch3 device, nemesis channel (with TCP and
shared memory), Hydra process management) of MPICH2 up and running.

1.  You will need the following prerequisites.

    - This tar file mpich2-%VERSION%.tar.gz

    - A C compiler (gcc is sufficient)

    - A Fortran compiler if Fortran applications are to be used
      (g77 or gfortran is sufficient) 

    - A C++ compiler for the C++ MPI bindings (g++ is sufficient)

    - If a Fortran 90 compiler is found, by default MPICH2 will
      attempt to build a basic MPI module.  This module contains the
      MPI routines that do not contain "choice" arguments; i.e., the module
      does not contain any of the communication routines, such as
      MPI_Send, that can take arguments of different type.  You may still
      use those routines, however, the MPI module does not contain
      interface specifications for them. If you have trouble with the
      configuration step and do not need Fortran 90, configure with
      --disable-fc .

    Configure will check for these prerequisites and try to work around
    deficiencies if possible.  (If you don't have Fortran, you will
    still be able to use MPICH2, just not with Fortran applications.)

    Also, you need to know what shell you are using since different shell
    has different command syntax. Command "echo $SHELL" prints out the
    current shell used by your terminal program.

2.  Unpack the tar file and go to the top level directory:

      tar xzf mpich2-%VERSION%.tar.gz
      cd mpich2-%VERSION%

    If your tar doesn't accept the z option, use

      gunzip mpich2-%VERSION%.tar.gz
      tar xf mpich2-%VERSION%.tar
      cd mpich2-%VERSION%

3.  Choose an installation directory, say /home/<USERNAME>/mpich2-install,
    which is assumed to non-existent or empty. It will be most
    convenient if this directory is shared by all of the machines
    where you intend to run processes.  If not, you will have 
    to duplicate it on the other machines after installation.

4.  Configure MPICH2 specifying the installation directory (the steps
    described here are called inpath build; we recommend user to do
    a vpath build if possible, see further below):

    for csh and tcsh:

      ./configure --prefix=/home/<USERNAME>/mpich2-install |& tee c.txt

    for bash and sh:

      ./configure --prefix=/home/<USERNAME>/mpich2-install 2>&1 | tee c.txt

    Bourne-like shells, sh and bash, accept "2>&1 |".  Csh-like shell,
    csh and tcsh, accept "|&".  File c.txt is used to store all messages
    generated configure command and is useful for diagnosis if something
    goes wrong.  Other configure options are described below.  You might
    also prefer to do a VPATH build (see below).  Check the c.txt file
    to make sure everything went well.  Problems should be self-explanatory,
    but if not, please attach c.txt to your bug report.

5.  Build MPICH2:

    for csh and tcsh:

      make |& tee m.txt

    for bash and sh:

      make 2>&1 | tee m.txt

    This step should succeed if there were no problems with the
    preceding step.  Check file m.txt. If there were problems,
    do a "make clean" and then run make again with V=1

      make V=1 |& tee m.txt       (for csh and tcsh)

      OR

      make V=1 2>&1 | tee m.txt   (for bash and sh)

    and then attach m.txt and c.txt to your bug report.

6.  Install the MPICH2 commands:

    for csh and tcsh:

      make install |& tee mi.txt

    for bash and sh:

      make install 2>&1 | tee mi.txt

    This step collects all required executables and scripts in the bin
    subdirectory of the directory specified by the prefix argument to
    configure. 

    (For users who want an install directory structure compliant to
     GNU coding standards (i.e., documentation files go to 
     ${datarootdir}/doc/${PACKAGE}, architecture-independent
     read-only files go to ${datadir}/${PACKAGE}), replace
     "make install" by

       make install PACKAGE=mpich2-<versrion>

     and corresponding installcheck step should be

       make installcheck PACKAGE=mpich2-<version>

    Setting PACKAGE in "make install" or "installcheck" step is optional
    and unnecessary for typical MPI users.)

7.  Add the bin subdirectory of the installation directory to your path:

    for csh and tcsh:

      setenv PATH /home/<USERNAME>/mpich2-install/bin:$PATH

    for bash and sh:
  
      PATH=/home/<USERNAME>/mpich2-install/bin:$PATH ; export PATH

    Check that everything is in order at this point by doing 

      which mpicc
      which mpiexec

    All should refer to the commands in the bin subdirectory of your
    install directory.  It is at this point that you will need to
    duplicate this directory on your other machines if it is not
    in a shared file system such as NFS.

8.  MPICH2 uses an external process manager for scalable startup of
    large MPI jobs.  The default process manager is called Hydra. More
    details on interacting with Hydra can be found at
    http://wiki.mcs.anl.gov/mpich2/index.php/Using_the_Hydra_Process_Manager

    To start a job on your local machine, you can use:

      mpiexec -n <number> ./examples/cpi

9. Test that you can run a multi-node job:

      mpiexec -f machinefile -n <number> ./examples/cpi

10. Now we will run an MPI job, using the mpiexec command as specified
    in the MPI-2 standard.  There are some examples in the install
    directory, which you have already put in your path, as well as in
    the directory mpich2-%VERSION%/examples.  One of them is the
    classic cpi example, which computes the value of pi by numerical
    integration in parallel.

      mpiexec -f machinefile -n 5 ./examples/cpi

    The cpi example will tell you which hosts it is running on.

    For additional mpiexec options, do:

      mpiexec --help

If you have completed all of the above steps, you have successfully
installed MPICH2 and run an MPI example.  

More details on arguments to mpiexec are given in the User's Guide in
the doc subdirectory. Also in the User's Guide you will find help on
debugging. MPICH2 has support for the TotalView debugger, as well as
some other approaches described there.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

II. Alternate Configure Options
===============================

The above steps utilized the MPICH2 defaults, which included choosing
TCP and shared memory for communication (via the "nemesis" channel)
and the Hydra process manager. Other alternatives are available.  You
can find out about configuration alternatives with

   ./configure --help

in the mpich2 directory.  The alternatives described below are
configured by adding arguments to the configure step.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

III. Compiler Flags
===================

MPICH2 allows several sets of compiler flags to be used. The first
three sets are configure-time options for MPICH2, while the fourth is
only relevant when compiling applications with mpicc and friends.

1. CFLAGS, CPPFLAGS, CXXFLAGS, FFLAGS, FCFLAGS, LDFLAGS and LIBS
(abbreviated as xFLAGS): Setting these flags would result in the
MPICH2 library being compiled/linked with these flags and the flags
internally being used in mpicc and friends.

2. MPICH2LIB_CFLAGS, MPICH2LIB_CPPFLAGS, MPICH2LIB_CXXFLAGS,
MPICH2LIB_FFLAGS, MPICH2LIB_FCFLAGS, MPICH2LIB_LDFLAGS and
MPICH2LIB_LIBS (abbreviated as MPICH2LIB_xFLAGS): Setting these flags
would result in the MPICH2 library being compiled/linked with these
flags. However, these flags will *not* be used by mpicc and friends.

3. MPICH2_MAKE_CFLAGS: Setting these flags would result in MPICH2's
configure tests to not use these flags, but the makefile's to use
them. This is a temporary hack for certain cases that advanced
developers might be interested in which break existing configure tests
(e.g., -Werror) and are not recommended for regular users.

4. MPICH2_MPICC_FLAGS, MPICH2_MPICPP_FLAGS, MPICH2_MPICXX_FLAGS,
MPICH2_MPIF77_FLAGS, MPICH2_MPIFC_FLAGS, MPICH2_LDFLAGS and
MPICH2_LIBS (abbreviated as MPICH2_MPIX_FLAGS): These flags do *not*
affect the compilation of the MPICH2 library itself, but will be
internally used by mpicc and friends.

  +--------------------+----------------------+------------------------+


All these flags can be set as part of configure command or through
environment variables.


Default flags
--------------
By default, MPICH2 automatically adds certain compiler optimizations
to MPICH2LIB_CFLAGS. The currently used optimization level is -O2.

** IMPORTANT NOTE: Remember that this only affects the compilation of
the MPICH2 library and is not used in the wrappers (mpicc and friends)
that are used to compile your applications or other libraries.

This optimization level can be changed with the --enable-fast option
passed to configure. For example, to build an MPICH2 environment with
-O3 for all language bindings, one can simply do:

  ./configure --enable-fast=O3

Or to disable all compiler optimizations, one can do:

  ./configure --disable-fast

For more details of --enable-fast, see the output of "configure
--help".


Examples
--------

Example 1:

  ./configure --disable-fast MPICH2LIB_CFLAGS=-O3 MPICH2LIB_FFLAGS=-O3 MPICH2LIB_CXXFLAGS=-O3 MPICH2LIB_FCFLAGS=-O3

This will cause the MPICH2 libraries to be built with -O3, and -O3
will *not* be included in the mpicc and other MPI wrapper script.

Example 2:

  ./configure --disable-fast CFLAGS=-O3 FFLAGS=-O3 CXXFLAGS=-O3 FCFLAGS=-O3

This will cause the MPICH2 libraries to be built with -O3, and -O3
will be included in the mpicc and other MPI wrapper script.

Example 3:

There are certain compiler flags that should not be used with MPICH2's
configure, e.g. gcc's -Werror, which would confuse configure and cause
certain configure tests to fail to detect the correct system features.
To use -Werror in building MPICH2 libraries, you can pass the compiler
flags during the make step through the Makefile variable
MPICH2_MAKE_CFLAGS as follows:

  make MPICH2_MAKE_CFLAGS="-Wall -Werror"

The content of MPICH2_MAKE_CFLAGS is appended to the CFLAGS in all
relevant Makefiles.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

IV. Alternate Channels and Devices
==================================

The communication mechanisms in MPICH2 are called "devices". MPICH2
supports several internal devices including ch3 (default), dcmfd (for
Blue Gene/P) and globus (for Globus), as well as many third-party
devices that are released and maintained by other institutes such as
osu_ch3 (from Ohio State University for InfiniBand and iWARP), ch_mx
(from Myricom for Myrinet MX), etc.

                   *************************************

ch3 device
**********
The ch3 device contains different internal communication options
called "channels". We currently support nemesis (default) and sock
channels, and experimentally provide a dllchan channel within the ch3
device.

nemesis channel
---------------
Nemesis provides communication using different networks (tcp, mx) as
well as various shared-memory optimizations. To configure MPICH2 with
nemesis, you can use the following configure option:

  --with-device=ch3:nemesis

The TCP network module gets configured in by default. To specify a
different network module such as MX, you can use:

  --with-device=ch3:nemesis:mx

If the MX include files and libraries are not in the normal search
paths, you can specify them with the following options:

  --with-mx-include= and --with-mx-lib=

... or the if lib/ and include/ are in the same directory, you can use
the following option:

  --with-mx=

If the MX libraries are shared libraries, they need to be in the
shared library search path. This can be done by adding the path to
/etc/ld.so.conf, or by setting the LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable in your
.bashrc (or .tcshrc) file.  It's also possible to set the shared
library search path in the binary. If you're using gcc, you can do
this by adding

  LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/lib

  (and)

  LDFLAGS="-Wl,-rpath -Wl,/path/to/lib"

... as arguments to configure.

By default, MX allows for only eight endpoints per node causing
ch3:nemesis:mx to give initialization errors with greater than 8
processes on the same node (this is an MX error and not an inherent
limitation in the MPICH2/Nemesis design). If needed, this can be set
to a higher number when MX is loaded. We recommend the user to contact
help@myri.com for details on how to do this.

Shared-memory optimizations are enabled by default to improve
performance for multi-processor/multi-core platforms. They can be
disabled (at the cost of performance) either by setting the
environment variable MPICH_NO_LOCAL to 1, or using the following
configure option:

  --enable-nemesis-dbg-nolocal

The --with-shared-memory= configure option allows you to choose how
Nemesis allocates shared memory.  The options are "auto", "sysv", and
"mmap".  Using "sysv" will allocate shared memory using the System V
shmget(), shmat(), etc. functions.  Using "mmap" will allocate shared
memory by creating a file (in /dev/shm if it exists, otherwise /tmp),
then mmap() the file.  The default is "auto". Note that System V
shared memory has limits on the size of shared memory segments so
using this for Nemesis may limit the number of processes that can be
started on a single node.


sock channel
------------
sock is the traditional TCP sockets based communication channel. It
uses TCP/IP sockets for all communication including intra-node
communication. So, though the performance of this channel is worse
than that of nemesis, it should work on almost every platform. This
channel can be configured using the following option:

  --with-device=ch3:sock

sctp channel
------------
The SCTP channel is a new channel using the Stream Control
Transmission Protocol (SCTP). This channel supports regular MPI-1
operations as well as dynamic processes and RMA from MPI-2; it
currently does not offer support for multiple threads.

Configure the sctp channel by using the following option:

  --with-device=ch3:sctp

If the SCTP include files and libraries are not in the normal search
paths, you can specify them with the --with-sctp-include= and
--with-sctp-lib= options, or the --with-sctp= option if lib/ and
include/ are in the same directory.

SCTP stack specific instructions:

  For FreeBSD 7 and onward, SCTP comes with CURRENT and is enabled with
  the "option SCTP" in the kernel configuration file.  The sctp_xxx()
  calls are contained within libc so to compile ch3:sctp, make a soft-link
  named libsctp.a to the target libc.a, then pass the path of the 
  libsctp.a soft-link to --with-sctp-lib.
  
  For FreeBSD 6.x, kernel patches and instructions can be downloaded at
  http://www.sctp.org/download.html .  These kernels place libsctp and
  headers in /usr, so nothing needs to be specified for --with-sctp
  since /usr is often in the default search path.

  For Mac OS X, the SCTP Network Kernel Extension (NKE) can be
  downloaded at http://sctp.fh-muenster.de/sctp-nke.html .  This places
  the lib and include in /usr, so nothing needs to be specified for
  --with-sctp since /usr is often in the default search path.

  For Linux, SCTP comes with the default kernel from 2.4.23 and later as
  a module.  This module can be loaded as root using "modprobe sctp".
  After this is loaded,  you can verify it is loaded using "lsmod".
  Once loaded, the SCTP socket lib and include files must be downloaded
  and installed from http://lksctp.sourceforge.net/ .  The prefix 
  location must then be passed into --with-sctp.  This bundle is called 
  lksctp-tools and is available for download off their website.

  For Solaris, SCTP comes with the default Solaris 10 kernel; the lib
  and include in /usr, so nothing needs to be specified for --with-sctp
  since /usr is often in the default search path.  In order to compile
  under Solaris, MPICH2LIB_CFLAGS must have
  -DMPICH_SCTP_CONCATENATES_IOVS set when running MPICH2's configure
  script.

                   *************************************

IBM Blue Gene/P device
**********************
MPICH2 also supports the IBM Blue Gene/P systems. Since BG/P's
front-end uses a different architecture than the actual compute nodes,
MPICH2 has to be cross-compiled for this platform. The configuration
of MPICH2 on BG/P relies on the availability of the DCMF driver stack
and cross compiler binaries on the system. These are packaged by IBM
in their driver releases (default installation path is
/bgsys/drivers/ppcfloor) and are not released with MPICH2.

Assuming DRIVER_PATH points to the driver installation path (e.g.,
/bgsys/drivers/ppcfloor), the following is an example configure
command-line for MPICH2:

  GCC=${DRIVER_PATH}/gnu-linux/bin/powerpc-bgp-linux-gcc \
  CC=${DRIVER_PATH}/gnu-linux/bin/powerpc-bgp-linux-gcc \
  CXX=${DRIVER_PATH}/gnu-linux/bin/powerpc-bgp-linux-g++ \
  F77=${DRIVER_PATH}/gnu-linux/bin/powerpc-bgp-linux-gfortran \
  FC=${DRIVER_PATH}/gnu-linux/bin/powerpc-bgp-linux-gfortran \
  CFLAGS="-mcpu=450fp2" \
  CXXFLAGS="-mcpu=450fp2" \
  FFLAGS="-mcpu=450fp2" \
  FCFLAGS="-mcpu=450fp2" \
  AR=${DRIVER_PATH}/gnu-linux/bin/powerpc-bgp-linux-ar \
  LD=${DRIVER_PATH}/gnu-linux/bin/powerpc-bgp-linux-ld \
  MSGLAYER_INCLUDE="-I${DRIVER_PATH}/comm/include" \
  MSGLAYER_LIB="-L${DRIVER_PATH}/comm/lib -ldcmfcoll.cnk -ldcmf.cnk -lpthread -lrt -L$DRIVER_PATH/runtime/SPI -lSPI.cna" \
  ./configure --with-device=dcmfd:BGP --with-pmi=no --with-pm=no --with-file-system=bgl \
  	      --enable-timer-type=device --with-cross=src/mpid/dcmfd/cross \
	      --host=powerpc-bgp-linux --target=powerpc-bgp-linux --build=powerpc64-linux-gnu

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

V. Alternate Process Managers
=============================

hydra
-----
Hydra is the default process management framework that uses existing
daemons on nodes (e.g., ssh, pbs, slurm, sge) to start MPI
processes. More information on Hydra can be found at
http://wiki.mcs.anl.gov/mpich2/index.php/Using_the_Hydra_Process_Manager

mpd
---
MPD was the traditional process manager in MPICH2. The file
mpich2-%VERSION%/src/pm/mpd/README has more information about
interactive commands for managing the ring of MPDs.

smpd
---- 
SMPD is a process management system for both Microsoft Windows and UNIX.
SMPD is capable of starting a job where some processes are running on
Windows and others are running on a variant of UNIX.  For more
information, please see mpich2-%VERSION%/src/pm/smpd/README.

gforker
-------
gforker is a process manager that creates processes on a single machine,
by having mpiexec directly fork and exec them.  This mechanism is
particularly appropriate for shared-memory multiprocessors (SMPs) where
you want to create all the processes on the same machine.  gforker is
also useful for debugging, where running all the processes on a single
machine is often convenient.

slurm
-----
SLURM is an external process manager not distributed with
MPICH2. However, we provide configure options that allow integration
with SLURM. To enable this support, use "--with-pmi=slurm
--with-pm=no" option with configure.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

VI. VPATH Builds
================
MPICH2 supports building MPICH in a different directory tree than the
one where the MPICH2 source is installed. This often allows faster
building, as the sources can be placed in a shared filesystem and the
builds done in a local (and hence usually much faster) filesystem.  To
make this clear, the following example assumes that the sources are
placed in /home/me/mpich2-<VERSION>, the build is done in
/tmp/me/mpich2, and the installed version goes into
/usr/local/mpich2-<VERSION>:

  shell$ cd /home/me
  shell$ tar xzf mpich2-<VERSION>.tar.gz
  shell$ cd /tmp/me

  shell$ mkdir mpich2
  shell$ cd mpich2
  shell$ /home/me/mpich2-<VERSION>/configure --prefix=/usr/local/mpich2-<VERSION>
  shell$ make
  shell$ make install

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

VII. Shared Libraries
=====================
Shared libraries are currently only supported for gcc (and gcc-like
compilers) on Linux and Mac and for cc on Solaris. To have shared
libraries created when MPICH2 is built, specify the following when
MPICH2 is configured:

    configure --enable-shared

For users who wish to manually control the linker parameters, this can
be done using:

    configure --enable-sharedlibs=gcc         (on Linux)
    configure --enable-sharedlibs=osx-gcc     (on Mac OS X)
    configure --enable-sharedlibs=solaris-cc  (on Solaris)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

VIII. Other Features
====================

MPICH2 has a number of other features. If you are exploring MPICH2 as
part of a development project the following configure options are
important:

Performance Options:

 --enable-fast - Turns off error checking and collection of internal
                 timing information

 --enable-timing=no - Turns off just the collection of internal timing
                 information

 --enable-ndebug - Turns on NDEBUG, which disables asserts. This is a
		subset of the optimizations provided by enable-fast,
		but is useful in environments where the user wishes
		to retain the debug symbols, e.g., this can be combined
		with the --enable-g option.

MPI Features:

  --enable-romio - Build the ROMIO implementation of MPI-IO.  This is
                 the default

  --with-file-system - When used with --enable-romio, specifies
                 filesystems ROMIO should support.  See README.romio.

  --enable-threads - Build MPICH2 with support for multi-threaded
                 applications. Only the sock and nemesis channels support
                 MPI_THREAD_MULTIPLE. 

  --with-thread-package - When used with --enable-threads, this option
                 specifies the thread package to use.  This option
                 defaults to "posix".  At the moment, only POSIX
                 threads are supported on UNIX platforms.  We plan to
                 support Solaris threads in the future.

Language bindings:

  --enable-f77 - Build the Fortran 77 bindings.  This is the default.
                 It has been tested with the Fortran parts of the Intel
                 test suite.

  --enable-fc  - Build the Fortran 90 bindings.  This is on by default.

  --enable-cxx - Build the C++ bindings.  This has been tested with the
                 Notre Dame C++ test suite and some additional tests.

Cross compilation:

  --with-cross=filename - Provide values for the tests that required
                 running a program, such as the tests that configure
                 uses to determine the sizes of the basic types.  This
                 should be a fine in Bourne shell format containing
                 variable assignment of the form

                     CROSS_SIZEOF_INT=2

                 for all of the CROSS_xxx variables.  A list will be
                 provided in later releases; for now, look at the
                 configure.in files.  This has not been completely
                 tested.

Error checking and reporting:

  --enable-error-checking=level - Control the amount of error checking.
                 Currently, only "no" and "all" is supported; all is the
                 default.

  --enable-error-messages=level - Control the aount of detail in error
                 messages.  By default, MPICH2 provides
                 instance-specific error messages; but, with this
                 option, MPICH2 can be configured to provide less
                 detailed messages.  This may be desirable on small
                 systems, such as clusters built from game consoles or
                 high-density massively parallel systems.  This is still
                 under active development.

Compilation options for development:

  --enable-g=value - Controls the amount of debugging information
                 collected by the code.  The most useful choice here is
                 dbg, which compiles with -g.

  --enable-coverage - An experimental option that enables GNU coverage
                 analysis.

  --with-logging=name - Select a logging library for recording the
                 timings of the internal routines.  We have used this to
                 understand the performance of the internals of MPICH2.
                 More information on the logging options, capabilities
                 and usage can be found in doc/logging/logging.pdf.

  --enable-timer-type=name -  Select the timer to use for MPI_Wtime
                 and internal timestamps.  name may be one of:
                     gethrtime        - Solaris timer (Solaris systems
                                        only) 
                     clock_gettime    - Posix timer (where available)
                     gettimeofday     - Most Unix systems
                     linux86_cycle    - Linux x86; returns cycle
                                        counts, not time in seconds*
                     linuxalpha_cycle - Like linux86_cycle, but for
                                        Linux Alpha* 
                     gcc_ia64_cycle   - IPF ar.itc timer*
                     device           - The timer is provided by the device
                 *Note that the cycle timers are intended to be used by
                  MPICH2 developers for internal low-level timing.
                  Normal users should not use these as they are not
                  guaranteed to be accurate in certain situations.

IX. Checkpoint/Restart
======================

MPICH2 supports checkpointing and restart fault-tolerance using BLCR.

Configuration
-------------

First, you need to have BLCR version 0.8.2 installed on your machine.
If it's installed in the default system location, add the following
two options to your configure command:

  --enable-checkpointing 
  --with-hydra-ckpointlib=blcr

If BLCR is not installed in the default system location, you'll need
to tell MPICH2's configure where to find it.  You might also need to
set the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable so that BLCR's shared
libraries can be found.  In this case add the following options to
your configure comment:

  --enable-checkpointing 
  --with-hydra-ckpointlib=blcr 
  --with-blcr=<BLCR_INSTALL_DIR> 
  LD_LIBRARY_PATH=<BLCR_INSTALL_DIR>/lib

where <BLCR_INSTALL_DIR> is the directory where BLCR has been
installed (whatever was specified in --prefix when BLCR was
configured).

Note, checkpointing is only supported with the Hydra process manager.
(Hyrda will configured by default, unless you choose something else
with the --with-pm= configure option.)

After it's configured compile as usual (e.g., make; make install).

Running an Application
----------------------

Hydra provides checkpoint/restart capability.  Currently, only BLCR is
being experimented with.  You can pick these through the mpiexec
option -ckpointlib to specify the checkpointing library to use and
-ckpoint-prefix to specify the prefix of the file to write the
checkpoint image to:

  mpiexec -ckpointlib blcr -ckpoint-prefix /tmp/app.ckpoint -f hosts \
  -n 4 ./app

While the application is running, the user can request for a
checkpoint at any time by sending a SIGUSR1 signal to mpiexec.

You can also automatically checkpoint the application at regular
intervals using the mpiexec option -ckpoint-interval (seconds):

  mpiexec -ckpointlib blcr -ckpoint-prefix /tmp/app.ckpoint \
  -ckpoint-interval 3600 -f hosts -n 4 ./app

The checkpoint/restart parameters can be controlled with the
environment variables HYDRA_CKPOINTLIB, HYDRA_CKPOINT_PREFIX and
HYDRA_CKPOINT_INTERVAL.

To restart a process:

  mpiexec -ckpointlib blcr -ckpoint-prefix /tmp/app.ckpoint -f hosts -n 4 -ckpoint-num <N>

where <N> is the checkpoint number you want to restart from.

These instructions can also be found on the MPICH2 wiki:

  http://wiki.mcs.anl.gov/mpich2/index.php/Checkpointing

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

X. Environment Variables
========================

MPICH2 provides several environment variables that have different
purposes.

Generic Environment Variables
-----------------------------

  MPICH_NO_LOCAL - Disable shared-memory communication. With this
         option, even communication within a node will use the network
         stack.

               ************************************

  MPICH_INTERFACE_HOSTNAME - Network interface to use for
         communication. By default MPICH2 picks the network interface
         representing the hostname (gotten by gethostbyname). Consider
         the following example:

% /sbin/ifconfig

eth0      Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 00:14:5E:57:C4:FA
          inet addr:192.148.3.182  Bcast:192.148.248.255  Mask:255.255.255.0
          inet6 addr: fe80::214:5eff:fe57:c4fa/64 Scope:Link
          UP BROADCAST RUNNING MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1
          RX packets:989925894 errors:0 dropped:7186 overruns:0 frame:0
          TX packets:1480277023 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0
          collisions:0 txqueuelen:1000
          RX bytes:441568994866 (411.2 GiB)  TX bytes:1864173370054 (1.6 TiB)
          Interrupt:185 Memory:e2000000-e2012100

myri0     Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 00:14:5E:57:C4:F8
          inet addr:10.21.3.182  Bcast:10.21.255.255  Mask:255.255.0.0
          inet6 addr: fe80::214:5eff:fe57:c4f8/64 Scope:Link
          UP BROADCAST RUNNING MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1
          RX packets:3068986439 errors:0 dropped:7841 overruns:0 frame:0
          TX packets:2288060450 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0
          collisions:0 txqueuelen:1000
          RX bytes:3598751494497 (3.2 TiB)  TX bytes:1744058613150 (1.5 TiB)
          Interrupt:185 Memory:e4000000-e4012100

In the above case the 192.148.x.x IP series refers to the standard
Ethernet (or Gigabit Ethernet) network, AND the 10.21.x.x series
refers to Myrinet.

To run over the Myrinet network use:

% mpiexec -np 1 -env MPICH_INTERFACE_HOSTNAME 10.21.3.182 ./foo

               ************************************

  MPICH_INTERFACE_HOSTNAME_R%d - Network interface to use for rank %d.

               ************************************

  MPICH_PORT_RANGE - Port range to use for MPICH2 internal TCP
         connections. This is useful when some of the host ports are
         blocked by a firewall. For example, setting MPICH_PORT_RANGE
         to "2000:3000" will ensure that MPICH2 will internally only
         uses ports between 2000 and 3000.

               ************************************

  MPICH_ASYNC_PROGRESS - Initiates a spare thread to provide
         asynchronous progress. This improves progress semantics for
         all MPI operations including point-to-point, collective,
         one-sided operations and I/O. Setting this variable would
         increase the thread-safety level to
         MPI_THREAD_MULTIPLE. While this improves the progress
         semantics, it might cause a small amount of performance
         overhead for regular MPI operations.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

XI. Developer Builds
====================
For MPICH2 developers who want to directly work on the svn, there are
a few additional steps involved (people using the release tarballs do
not have to follow these steps). Details about these steps can be
found here:
http://wiki.mcs.anl.gov/mpich2/index.php/Getting_And_Building_MPICH2

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

XII. Building ROMIO into MPICH2
===============================
By default, ROMIO, an implementation of the I/O portion of MPI-2 will
be built as a part of MPICH2. The file systems to be built can be
speicified by passing them in a '+'-delimited list to the
--with-file-system configure option. For example:

  --with-file-system="pvfs+nfs+ufs"

If you have installed version 2 of the PVFS file system, you can use
the '--with-pvfs2=<prefix>' configure option to specify where
libraries, headers, and utilities have been installed. If you have
added the pvfs utilities to your PATH, then ROMIO will detect this and
build support for PVFS automatically.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

XIII. Testing the MPICH2 installation
=====================================
To test MPICH2, use the following options after installing mpich2.
These will assume that mpich2 is installed into /usr/local/mpich2.

1. MPICH2 test suite:

   shell$ make testing

The results summary will be placed in test/summary.xml 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

XIV. Installing MPICH2 on Windows
=================================

Here are the instructions for setting up MPICH2 on a Windows machine:

0) Install:
    Microsoft Developer Studio 2003 or later
    Intel Fortran 8.0 or later
    cygwin
	choose the dos file format option
	install perl and cvs

1) Checkout mpich2:

    Bring up a command prompt.
    (replace "yourname" with your MCS login name):
    svn co https://svn.mcs.anl.gov/repos/mpi/mpich2/trunk mpich2

2) Generate *.h.in

    Bring up a cygwin bash shell.
    cd mpich2
    maint/updatefiles
    exit

3) Execute winconfigure.wsf

4) Open Developer Studio

    open mpich2\mpich2.sln
    build the ch3sockDebug mpich2 solution
    build the ch3sockDebug mpich2s project
    build the ch3sockRelease mpich2 solution
    build the ch3sockRelease mpich2s project
    build the Debug mpich2 solution
    build the Release mpich2 solution
    build the fortDebug mpich2 solution
    build the fortRelease mpich2 solution
    build the gfortDebug mpich2 solution
    build the gfortRelease mpich2 solution
    build the sfortDebug mpich2 solution
    build the sfortRelease mpich2 solution

5) Open a command prompt

    cd to mpich2\maint
    execute "makegcclibs.bat"

6) Open another Developer Studio instance

    open mpich2\examples\examples.sln
    build the Release target of the cpi project

7) Return to Developer Studio with the mpich2 solution

    set the version numbers in the Installer project
    build the Installer mpich2 solution

8) Test and distribute mpich2\maint\ReleaseMSI\mpich2.msi

    mpich2.msi can be renamed, eg mpich2-1.1.msi

9) To install the launcher:

    Copy smpd.exe to a local directory on all the nodes.
    Log on to each node as an administrator and execute "smpd.exe -install"

10) Compile and run an MPI application:

    Compile an mpi application.  Use mpi.h from mpich2\src\include\win32 
    and mpi.lib in mpich2\lib
    
    Place your executable along with the mpich2 dlls somewhere accessable
    to all the machines.
    
    Execute a job by running something like: mpiexec -n 3 myapp.exe

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

XIV. Multiple Fortran compiler support
======================================

If the C compiler that is used to build MPICH2 libraries supports both
multiple weak symbols and multiple aliases of common symbols, the Fortran 77
binding can support multiple Fortran compilers.  The multiple weak symbols
support allow MPICH2 to provide different name mangling scheme (of
subroutine names) required by differen Fortran compilers.  The multiple
aliases of common symbols support enables MPICH2 to equal different common
block symbols of the MPI Fortran constant, e.g. MPI_IN_PLACE,
MPI_STATUS_IGNORE...  So they are understood by different Fortran compilers.

Since the support of multiple aliases of common symbols is new/experimental,
users can disable the feature by using configure option --disable-multi-aliases
if it causes any undesirable effect, e.g. linker warnings of different sizes
of common symbols, MPIFCMB* (the warning should be harmless).

We have only tested this support on a limited set of platforms/compilers.
On linux, if the C compiler that builds MPICH2 is either gcc or icc,
the above support will be enabled by configure.  At the time of this
writing, pgcc does not seem to have this multiple aliases of common symbols,
so configure will detect the deficiency and disable the feature automatically.
The tested Fortran compiler includes GNU Forran compilers(gfortan, g77),
Intel Fortran compiler(ifort), Portland Group Fortran compilers(pgf77, pgf90), 
Absoft Fortran compilers (af77, af90), and IBM XL fortran compiler(xlf).
What this mean is that if mpich2 is built by gcc/gfortran, the resulting
mpich2 library can be used to link a Fortran program compiled/linked by
another fortran compiler, say pgf77, say through mpif77 -f77=pgf77.
As long as the Fortran program is linked without any errors by
one of these compilers, the program shall be running fine.
