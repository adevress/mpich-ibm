# Need to patch some things up: put a local copy of confdb in the directory
# and make configure use that.  We also need to rebuild configure, since
# automake has already done that. 
# An alternative is to copy the confdb directory here rather than link to the
# master one in MPICH2.  The drawback to that approach is that critical macros
# might be deleted by someone looking at the confdb in this test directory,
# on the basis that they are not used by the tests, even though they are needed
# by MPICH2 or other tools.  As this very problem has (and continues) to happen,
# it is safer to use the master confdb.
# Make sure to disable rebuilding the autotools related files - the 
# receiver of this distribution may not have the necessary tools and 
# should not need them.  Finally, the distributed configure must disable
# maintainer targets by default - otherwise, the unsuspecting user will
# see automake et al attempt to rebuild the autotools, which is likely to 
# fail unless the user has the correct versions of all of the tools
