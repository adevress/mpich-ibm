GASNet DCMF-conduit documentation
Rajesh Nishtala <rajeshn@cs.berkeley.edu>


Notes about building the conduit:
MAKE SURE THAT THE DCMF BACKEND AND GASNET ARE BUILT W/ THE SAME COMPILER SUITE!!
---> looks like XLC and GCC play well together *most* of the time but break in subtle places when it comes to alignment



Recognized environment variables:
GASNET_DCMF_EAGER_LIMIT: transfer size to switch between internal DCMF eager and rendez-vous AM protocols
