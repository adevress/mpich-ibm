Berkeley UPC: runtime package
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is the runtime component of the Berkeley UPC compiler.  It also contains
the 'upcc' front end to the UPC compilation system (like 'gcc' is the front end
to the GNU C compiler).

To use this code, you need to build this package, and then configure it to point
to an instance of our UPC-to-C translator (which comes as a separate package:
see http://upc.lbl.gov/download), or the GCC UPC binary UPC compiler (see
http://www.intrepid.com/upc/).  See the INSTALL.TXT file in this directory for
instructions on building/installing/configuring.

For a list of the platforms currently supported by Berkeley UPC, see
gasnet/README. 

For user documentation, and information on some of the internals of the Berkeley
UPC runtime implementation, see the files in the 'docs' directory.
