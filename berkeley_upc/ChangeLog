2004-12-06 Berkeley UPC release 2.1.0 (2.2 BETA 1)
    - IMPORTANT: this is a BETA release, and may not be as stable as our
      official releases.
    - Added a reference implementation of the UPC I/O spec.  This
      implementation is not designed to be highly performant, but it is
      believed to be complete and stable.
    - The SHMEM network API is now supported, at least on SGI Altix and Cray
      X1 systems.
    - Support for Quadrics' Elan 4 API added.  Performance tuning is not yet
      complete, but the implementation is stable.
    - Support for using GCC/UPC 3.3.2.9.  You must upgrade to this version of the
      runtime if you wish to use this version (or greater) of GCC/UPC, due to
      changes in the GCC/UPC interface.
    - Improved the automated UPC test harness to support any UPC 1.1 compiler

2004-10-04 Berkeley UPC release 2.0.1

2004-09-15 Berkeley UPC release 2.0
    - Full implementation of UPC collectives (as per version 1.0 of the UPC
      Collective specification)
    - MPI/C++/C/FORTRAN/UPC interoperability support added
    - Runtime now works with GCC UPC binary compiler (see INSTALL.TXT for more
      information)
    - Runtime memory allocator no longer divides shared memory 50-50% between
      upc_global_alloc/upc_all_alloc and upc_alloc: either type of allocation
      allowed to go over 50% of shared region, so long as total of both < 100%
    - Added '-network=udp' which runs UPC over UDP, and is thus supported by
      any network with a standard TCP/IP stack (this is now the recommended
      layer for use on Ethernet hardware).
    - Added numerous Berkeley-specific extensions to the UPC memcpy libraries
       to support explicitly asynchronous and non-contiguous bulk data movement
       (see http://upc.lbl.gov/publications/upc_memcpy.pdf).
    - Experimental support for Dolphin SCI networks.
    - Ported to new platforms: Cray X1, AMD Athlon/Opteron, Sun Pro C, HP C

       network traffic
    - GM (Myrinet) network layer now supports pthreaded UPC applications
    - Added auto-detection of most network drivers
    - Fixes to ensure memory consistency behavior matches the current 
       memory model proposal (due to be introduced in UPC spec 1.2)
    - Runtime interface has changed, so 1.x translators/runtimes will not work
       with their 2.x counterparts (i.e. if you have installed your own
       translator, you will need to upgrade it at the same time as your
       runtime).
    - Enhanced heuristics for detecting C-mode and UPC-mode headers when
       compiling for pthreads
    - Greatly expanded compiler automated test suite, which is now run 
       nightly on many platforms
    - Many, many bugfixes, and much-improved stability/portability.
